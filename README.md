# AI2_SSH_EXTENSION
Android client SSH extension for MIT Application Inventor 2

This is an AI2 extension made in Java for Android, compiled with the Apache ANT builder. It allows issuing Linux Bash/Shell commands to a remote SSH server, prefereably done in short execution, once the runnable thread runs under the AssyncTask, otherwise the whole application will become unresponsive to user interactions.

Bellow, a snapshot of the Component collection:
